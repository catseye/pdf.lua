pdf.lua
=======

This is a pure Lua library for low-level generation of PDF files.

This is code I wrote, oh gosh, about 10 years ago now, and I have no plans to
develop it further.  It is probably more valuable as a demonstration that it's
really not that difficult to create a PDF file, than as a serious piece of
equipment.  However, I just tried the test script with Lua 5.1.5, using
Firefox 33.0 as the PDF viewer, and it still works.

This work is in the public domain; see the file UNLICENSE for details.
